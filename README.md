#CodeFellowship
App by Peter Tynan

##Feature Tasks
- Allow users to log in to CodeFellowship and create posts.

- Using the above cheat sheet, add the ability for users to log in to your app.
- Upon logging in, users should be taken to a /myprofile route that displays their information.
- Ensure that your homepage, login, and registration routes are accessible to non-logged in users. All other routes should be limited to logged-in users.
- Ensure that user registration also logs users into your app automatically.
- Add a Post entity to your app.
- A Post has a body and a createdAt timestamp.
- A logged-in user should be able to create a Post, and a post should belong to the user that created it.
- A user’s posts should be visible on their profile page.
- When a user is logged in, the app should display the user’s username on every page (probably in the heading).
